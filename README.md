## Description

This study guide was made to complete the prework section of the DU Fullstack Developer course. I built this website to practive coding and learn the basics needed to succeed in the course. It allows the user to randomly select a topic to study in the consule of the webpage.  I learned the absolute basics of coding using the languanges HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. 

## Usage

Each section of the webpage has notes on the languages that were used in the process to make it.  If you would like to randomly select a topic to study you can open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I for MacOS or Control+Shift+I for Windows.  The console will list the available topics and then randomly select one to be studied.
